# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you making this list better for everyone.

1. Keep it awesome. We'd like to include only high‑quality, actively maintained resources related to arXiv or arXiv‑sourced literature.
2. One link per pull request (unless closely related) to keep reviews quick.
3. Add links alphabetically inside the correct section.
4. Use the following format:
```
- **[Project Name](https://example.com)** — a short description, just a couple of sentences highlighting the main features.
```
